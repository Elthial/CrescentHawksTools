# CrescentHawksTools
 
This is a toolkit for extracting the assets from the Crescent Hawks: Inception game.
Support for Crescent Hawks: Revenge will come later.

Currently capable of extracting:
* Fullscreen graphics
* Map files
* Spritesheets 
* Tile Sheets

These are all the .ICN, .CMP and .MAP files within the Btech folder.

Remaining assets to extract:
* World map (Stored within EXE, possibly procedural generated?)
* Sound files (Need to write converter to WAV)
